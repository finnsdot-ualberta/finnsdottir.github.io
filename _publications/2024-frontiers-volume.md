excerpt: 'Recent decades have seen a surge in anti-democratic and radical politics across North American and the European Union. Trust in politics has fallen, and misinformation has proliferated at an incredible rate. These political shifts have hit at the foundation of Western democracies, calling into question their legitimacy, and fueling the rise of radical and anti-democratic political parties and politicians. The spread of misinformation through digital and traditional media has contributed to the politicization of immigration, which in turn contributes to political polarization. The impact of post-truth politics on the public sphere, on the legitimacy of the EU, and on the health of democratic systems is clearly of the utmost concern. 
The central goal of this Research Topic is to analyze, through a comparative lens, the extent and impact of disinformation and post-truth politics in Western democracies. The articles in this Topic take up different aspects of the proliferation of dis- and mis-information through digital and conventional media. In particular, the articles interrogate the impact of this proliferation of post-truth politics on the processes of legitimation of European integration in the public sphere.'
